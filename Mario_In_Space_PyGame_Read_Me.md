Mario In Space PyGame

Today we will learn about Pygame and make a mario Space Game 

First we need to install two things before we get started

In vscode in your terminal you will enter in two lines of code and run both separately.

First we will enter in:

pip install pygame

Than we will run this command in the terminal 

Now we will do the same for the following line of code:

pip install pytmx

This will install the needed libraries we need to run the game using python.

Now finally to run the game we will need to run this command in the terminal: 

python mario-in-space.py
